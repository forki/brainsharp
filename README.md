## About
Brainsharp is a [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) SDK written in F#.

It aims to be the fastest way to run brainfuck programs.

It has an ever-evolving interpreter with an optimizer and a native IL compiler to come.

## Download
Brainsharp now went stable! :confetti_ball:
